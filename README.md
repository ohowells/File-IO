# File IO

Here some different file IO code I have written over the last little while.

### Delimiter-separated-values
Reads some kinds of data (integers at the moment) from a file that are separated
by some kind of character (, . "" '' etc.) and stores them in a vector.

To run type the commands:

>make dsv                                                                       
>./f_io.o

### Get-line-x
Finds a specified line of a file and prints it.

To run type the commands:

>make glx                                                                       
>./f_io.o
